This is a code create by Faber Bernardo Júnior!
With the idea to do a average calculator, based in c.
I made this in my free time using my knowledge in the language c.
This is not perfect, but it's a begin!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The logic is simple, we have eigh floats, this floats are our variables.
First, i say that the "smaller" is equal to a number i like, ex smaller=100000.
Second i say bigger is equal to a zero, because we need to compare on the calc.
Then i put the totalAverage=0 and iterar=0, because i need the values ​​to be accumulated in each code run.
Initially i do a print on the screen, asking the person to put a number, then i scan the screen to read what they put.
If the value the person puts is less than/equal to zero, i close the code, else, i run the code.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Initially, I use a while as a continuity parameter, since, as long as the value inside it is true, it will execute the code, when it is false, it will break the process.
Inside the while, I put the value iterar < number, if it's true, i run a print and a scan, the print asks the person to put a number, and the scan to capture what was written.
Two ifs, the first one checks if the value entered is bigger than my bigger value, and the second if checks if the value entered is less than my smaller value.
And for each if, if it is true, i store the typed value, saying that it is equal to the variable that was compared.
Then i add by iterar +1, and add the value of the number to my overall average.
Adding +1 to the iterar will cause the while to run until the value of the iterar is bigger than the value of number entered by the person initially.
Finally, after the iterar is bigger than the number entered, i do the comparison of two values, if my average<overallAverage, if my average>overallAverage, if not i say average==overallAverage
The value average and overallAverage is a float that store the calc until the end running code.
